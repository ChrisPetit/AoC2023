# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions (C#)

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in C#. Advent of Code is an annual series of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that span a variety of skill sets and difficulty levels. These puzzles are a great way to improve your coding skills and have some fun during the holiday season!

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an initiative by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) that presents an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. These puzzles are designed to be solved with a variety of programming languages and are suitable for a range of skill levels.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse the solutions and the accompanying tests. Each day's folder contains the C# solution for the puzzle or a set of unit tests written using xUnit.
